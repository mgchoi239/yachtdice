# Yahtzee

A few weeks ago, I had the chance to play [Yahtzee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee) for the first time with a close acquaintance. Being a Math and Stats major, I found myself naturally drawn to calculating the optimal choices for each round. Despite our initial plans to play a variety of board games, we found ourselfs indulged in Yahtzee for well over four hours.

Returning home, it was only natural as an aspiring developer to digitally recreate the game. This period coincided with when I was interested in socket management. Although I had taken a class in Internet Architecture and Protocol a year ago, creating a service using sockets was a new challenge, given that modern development often relies on REST API to abstract lower-level details.

Taking this excuse to merge my newfound interest in Yahtzee and my learning journey in socket applications, I dedicated hours to playing Yahtzee solo while gaining practical insights into the applications of [sockets](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html).
